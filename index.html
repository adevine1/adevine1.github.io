        This is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (i.e., Yahtzee) that I wrote in HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Handheld-Yahtzee-Clear-black/dp/B003ISFZYM/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=hand+held+yahtzee&qid=1575773127&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-2"> hand-held device </a>that I've played to death over the years. I cloned it a number of years ago on Windows, and I wanted to recreate the experience as closely as I could on the web. It uses local storage to persist high-score data between sessions.
