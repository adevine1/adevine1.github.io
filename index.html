    <h4>some things:</h4>

    <h5>
      <a href="/projects/getfive/index.html">Get Five!</a>
    <h5>
        Get Five! is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (i.e., Yahtzee) that I wrote in
        HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based on a
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Milton-Bradley-Yahtzee-Handheld-Electronic/dp/B003EDYE02"
        >
          hand-held device</a
        >
        that I played quite a bit over the years. <a href="getfivepc.jpg">I cloned it</a> a number of years
        ago for Windows (in <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi</a>), and this is a similar sort of project in JavaScript. Get Five! uses local storage to persist high-score data
        and user settings between sessions.
