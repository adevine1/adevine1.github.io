      Hey there! This is a place for me to share a bit about what I'm working on
      in terms of coding. It's a place to show what I can do along the
      full-stack, and also a place to put some of the things I'm working on for
      fun. To see more, my github profile is here. More to come...
    </p>

        This is a Yahtzee clone that I write in pure HTML/CSS/JS that is based
        on a Windows version I also made a number of years ago. It's based on
        this hand-held device that I've played to death over the years. I
        primarily tried to write it without any additional library, although I
        do implement some JQuery when I tried to clean up the UI. Makes for a
        much better experience, IMO.
