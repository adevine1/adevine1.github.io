      I'm currently working on a project to assess  scope and impact on individuals and workgroups across an organization during times of change. Financial assessments come easier, but it is not often easy to visualize "weight commitments" on front-end workers in a comprehensive way â€” in other words, the "cumulative weight" of needed tasks happening in key places during times of transition. Too much weight in any one area at a given time, and change can be a recipe for higher than anticipated costs, as well as lower employee morale and productivity. My goal is to design a tool to visualize how change happens globally in an organization so decisionmakers have data for good "change management," especially as those transitions impact valuable employee assets.

      Some other code I've written:

      <a href="/projects/getfive/index.html" target="_blank">Get Five!</a>
    <h5>
        Get Five! is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (i.e., Yahtzee) that I wrote in
        HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based on a
        <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=yahtzee+handheld+1995+black" target="_blank">hand-held device</a> that I played quite a bit over the years. <a href="getfivepc.jpg" target="_blank">I made a clone of it</a> a number of years
        ago for Windows (in <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi" target="_blank">Delphi</a>), and this is a similar sort of project in JavaScript. Get Five! uses local storage to persist high-score data
        and user settings (i.e., sound effects on or off) between sessions.

    <h5>
            Petals Around the Rose is an implementation of one of my favorite puzzle games. I wrote it in HTML/CSS/JQuery. It embodies a minimalist design, yet it is a good brain teaser for various levels of puzzle solving ability. Also, it's ephemeral: once it's solved, it cannot really be "played" again. I wrote it in HTML/CSS/JQuery.

            The rules of Petals Around the Rose are simple: guess the result of six dice that are rolled. The trick is that there is a specific way of calculating the total. To win the game, figure out how it is done. The only clue is the name of the game.
