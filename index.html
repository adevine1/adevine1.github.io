      <a href="/projects/getfive/index.html">Get Five!</a>
      <h5>
        Get Five! is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (i.e., Yahtzee) that I wrote in
        HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based on a
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Handheld-Yahtzee-Clear-black/dp/B003ISFZYM/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=hand+held+yahtzee&qid=1575773127&s=toys-and-games&sr=1-2"
        >
          hand-held device</a
        >
        that I have played to death over the years. I cloned it a number of years
        ago for Windows (in Delphi), and I also wanted to see if I could do it for the web. Get Five! uses local storage to persist high-score data
        between sessions.
