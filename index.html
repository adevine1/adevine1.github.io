      Hey there! This is a place for me to share a bit about what I'm working on
      in terms of coding. <br><br>

      To see more, my github profile is <a href="https://github.com/adevine1">here</a>. More to come...<br> <br>

    <h3>Some Things I've Done</h3>

        This is a Yahtzee clone that I write in HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery that is based
        on a Windows version I also made a number of years ago. Its original motivation was a hand-held device that I've played to death over the years, and I wanted to recreate the experience as closely as I could on a PC (and now on the web).
