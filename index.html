    </h4>
      <p>
        Get Five! is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (i.e., Yahtzee) that I wrote in
        HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based on a
        <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=yahtzee+handheld+1995+black" target="_blank">hand-held device</a> that I played quite a bit over the years. <a href="getfivepc.jpg" target="_blank">I made a clone of it</a> a number of years
        ago for Windows (in <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi" target="_blank">Delphi</a>), and this is a similar sort of project in JavaScript. Get Five! uses local storage to persist high-score data
        and user settings (i.e., sound effects on or off) between sessions.

          <a href="/projects/petals-around-the-rose/index.html" target="_blank">Petals Around the Rose</a>
    </h4>
          <p>
            Petals Around the Rose is an implementation of one of my favorite puzzle games. I wrote it in HTML/CSS/JQuery. It embodies a minimalist design, yet it is a good brain teaser for various levels of puzzle solving ability. Also, it's ephemeral: once it's solved, it cannot really be "played" again. I wrote it in HTML/CSS/JQuery.

            The rules of Petals Around the Rose are simple: guess the result of six dice that are rolled. The trick is that there is a specific way of calculating the total. To win the game, figure out how it is done. The only clue is the name of the game.

      <h4><a href="/projects/simple-notes/index.html" >Simple Notes</a></h4>
      <p>
        Simple Notes is a very (very) simple place to jot notes, written in HTML/JS/CSS. It's a no-frills, not-meant-for-super-safe-keeping, one-font text editor. It's perfect for jotting something down quickly (say, while taking a phone call). It has one undo via a right-click with the mouse. It persists data on 'save' using local storage. (I keep it as the first upper-left bookmark on my bookmark bar, as it's quicker to access than other text programs I use. "Click-of-a-button accessible to jot down something not super-vital" is what I was going for.)

      <p>
        A very simple to-do list written in HTML/JS/CSS that persists data using local storage, written in the spirit of Simple Notes. More to come...
