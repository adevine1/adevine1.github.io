              <p class="card-text">Simple Notes is a very (very) simple place to put notes, written in Bootstrap/HTML/JS/CSS. It's a no-frills, one-font text editor. It's for jotting something down quickly (say, while taking a phone call). It saves data as you type using local storage. (I keep it as the left-most bookmark on my bookmark bar, as it's quicker to access than other text programs I use. "Click-of-a  -button accessible to jot down something not super-vital" is what I was going for.) It is optimized for mobile, so a shortcut to this link on a phone mimics an app for taking notes.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This is a simple to-do list that is written in html and Bootstrap. I like Bootstrap, as it optimizes for mobility first (i.e., it resizes appropriately no matter the screen size, but it doesn't treat mobile as an afterthought). This to-do list does not use local storage, like Simple Notes does. Rather, it runs on a server written in Express (and hosted on Heroku), and it saves data in a MongoDB Atlas database. As such, access to the following link is always access to the same list (for the entire internet, basically, as there is currently no login feature).

              <h5 class="card-title">Get Five!</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Get Five! is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (Yahtzee) that I wrote in HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based on a hand-held device that I've played quite a lot. I made a clone of it awhile ago for Windows (in Delphi), and I thought to try it again in JavaScript. Get Five! uses local storage to persist high-score data and user settings (i.e., sound effects on or off) between sessions. It is not optimized for mobile, so it is best to play it on a larger screen.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Petals Around the Rose is an implementation of a puzzle game I am fond of. I like the puzzle because it embodies a minimalist design, yet it is a good brain teaser for varying levels of puzzle solving ability. Also, it's ephemeral: once it's solved, it cannot really be "played" again. I wrote it in HTML/CSS/JQuery. The rules of Petals Around the Rose are simple: guess the result of six dice that are rolled. The trick is that there is a specific way of calculating the total. To win the game, figure out how it is done. The only clue is the name of the game. It can be played on mobile, but optimized for larger screens.</p>
