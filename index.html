      This is a place for me to share coding things I've been working on. <br /><br />

      My github profile is
      <a href="https://github.com/adevine1">here</a>. <br />
      <br />

      Right now I'm in the initial states of working on a project that is designed to assess the impact of projects on individuals and workgroups across an organization during times of change. Often, there are financial assessments done, but often not one that assesses "weight commitments" for front-end workers -- in other words, the "cumulative weight" of various tasks happening at key times during times of change. My goal is to design tools to visualize how this impact happens to share between decisionmakers that allow for "good change management" as it affects valuable employee assets.

    <h4>some other things:</h4>

      <a href="/projects/getfive/index.html">Get Five!</a>
    <h5>
        Get Five! is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (i.e., Yahtzee) that I wrote in
        HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based on a

          hand-held device</a
        >
        that I played quite a bit over the years. <a href="getfivepc.jpg">I cloned it</a> a number of years
        ago for Windows (in <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi</a>), and this is a similar sort of project in JavaScript. Get Five! uses local storage to persist high-score data
        and user settings between sessions.
