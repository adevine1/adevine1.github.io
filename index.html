      This is a place for me to share coding things I've been working on. <br><br>

      My github profile is <a href="https://github.com/adevine1">here</a>. <br><br>
      I'm in the initial states of working on a project that is designed to assess the scope and impact of projects on individuals and workgroups across an organization during times of change. Cumulative financial assessments are easier to calculate, but it is not often easy to visualize "weight commitments" on front-end workers -- in other words, the "cumulative weight" of needed tasks happening in key places during times of change. My goal is to help design a tool to visualize how  change happens globally in an organization to provide decisionmakers with data to allow for good "change management," especially as that change impacts valuable employee assets.

        Get Five! is a clone of a popular 5-dice game (i.e., Yahtzee) that I wrote in
        HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery. It is based on a

        that I played quite a bit over the years. <a href="getfivepc.jpg">I cloned it</a> a number of years
        ago for Windows (in <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi</a>), and this is a similar sort of project in JavaScript. Get Five! uses local storage to persist high-score data
        and user settings between sessions.
